#Three Men's Morris

This is a project I completed in a Web Development Immersive at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/).

Three Men's Morris is a game for old English sailors which, much like tic-tac-toe, can be 'solved' (you can force a tie) - but it's still good for a few minutes of entertainment. Instructions are included in the project, further reading can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Men%27s_Morris).
